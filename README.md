## Introduction
MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. This project aims to showcase how to effectively use MLflow for tracking machine learning experiments.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Digvijay25/MLOps-With-MLflow.git
cd MLOps-With-MLflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Follow these steps to run your ML experiments using MLflow:

1. **Set up MLflow Tracking Server (optional):**
   - If you want to use a remote tracking server, set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable to the URL of your tracking server.

2. **Run the Experiment:**
   - Use the provided scripts or notebooks to run your experiments. For example:
     ```bash
     python your_experiment_script.py
     ```

3. **View Experiment Results:**
   - Start the MLflow UI using the command:
     ```bash
     mlflow ui
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view and analyze your experiment results.

## Experiment Tracking
This repository includes example scripts and notebooks that demonstrate how to use MLflow for:
- Tracking parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Logging models
- Comparing different runs
